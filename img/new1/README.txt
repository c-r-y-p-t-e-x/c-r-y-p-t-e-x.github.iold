A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/JulianLaval/pen/KpLXOO.

 In this experiment, I set out to build a sexy, simple, interactive, and animated particle network using Canvas and JavaScript. Fully plug n' play, modular, and customisable, just drop it in any webpage.
